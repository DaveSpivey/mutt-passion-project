#MuttWhat

Phase 2 passion project for DevBootcamp.

My goal for this project is to make an app for displaying images of dogs and having an interactive guessing system for users. A user can flip through pictures and guess from a selection of breeds, contributing to the pool of user-sourced guesses. A dog can be associated with a 'top-3' list of most guessed breeds.

Use of this app can be low on time-commitment: A non-registered user can flip through pictures of dogs and guess at will, or optionally click on any dog and view the dog's profile. Guessing will not be restricted to registered users, but a logged-in user may upload their own images and make their own dog profiles.
